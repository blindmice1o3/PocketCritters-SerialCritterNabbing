    "In all core series games since Generation III, vitamins that affect stats increase a Pok√©mon's
    EVs for a given stat by 10 EV points,
    but can't increase the total EVs beyond a maximum of 510.
    Between Generations III and VII, vitamins will also have no effect on an individual stat that
    already has 100 or more EVs.
    Prior to Generation III, effort values were based on a system of
    stat experience and vitamins increased a stat by 2560 EV points,
    but could only be used until the stat had 25600 EVs."
